# Introduction

The increasing complexity of urban landscapes necessitates efficient
systems for city navigation and route optimization. To address this
challenge, a project was undertaken to develop an inter-city map
using C++ and graph algorithms. The primary goal was to create a
tool that could provide users with valuable information about the
shortest distances between cities and optimal routes, considering both
day and night travel scenarios.

## Problem Statement-
Navigating through a network of interconnected cities efficiently is crucial for various applications, including transportation planning and
logistics. The challenge lies in developing a system that not only
accurately represents the interconnections between cities but also
provides users with dynamic solutions based on different time
scenarios. The problem statement involves constructing a robust inter-
city map and implementing algorithms to find the shortest distances
between cities as well as the optimal routes, considering both day and
night conditions.

## Solution Approach:
The solution to the stated problem involves the use of C++ programming language and graph algorithms. The project utilizes a graph-based approach, where cities are represented as nodes, and the
connections between them as edges. The implementation incorporates
two graphs – one for day travel and another for night travel – reflecting
the varying conditions and distances between cities at different times.
To construct the inter-city map, a class named 'mapp' is designed,
encapsulating functionalities such as adding cities, adding edges for
day and night travel, and preprocessing the graph. The Floyd-Warshall
algorithm is employed to determine the shortest distances between all
pairs of cities, offering a comprehensive overview of the city network.
For individual route optimization, a modified Dijkstra's algorithm is
implemented. Users can input their current city, destination city, and
the time of day (day or night). The algorithm then calculates the
shortest path, considering the specified time scenario. The project also
incorporates user-friendly queries, allowing individuals to interactively
explore the city network and receive real-time information about
distances and routes.
This project's comprehensive solution addresses the need for efficient
city navigation, providing a valuable tool for individuals and
organizations involved in transportation and logistics planning. The
incorporation of graph algorithms ensures accuracy and speed in
determining optimal routes, making it a versatile and practical solution
for real-world applications.
